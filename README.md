# **NAME**

grcarma - GUI to molecular dynamics trajectories analysis program carma

# **SYNOPSIS**

grcarma [ PSF FILE ] [ DCD FILE ]

grcarma.exe [ PSF FILE ] [ DCD FILE ]

# **DESCRIPTION**

grcarma is a GUI to molecular dynamics trajectories analysis program [carma](http://utopia.duth.gr/~glykos/Carma.html). It is written in Perl and makes use of the Tk module for graphics. It is available for Linux and Windows, and requires the carma executable in the same folder ( or in the PATH ). As seen in the synopsis the program can be launched with  a .psf / .dcd pair of files as arguments. Alternatively, the program can be run without any arguments and the user will be prompted to specify the files to use for the analyses, through a graphical interface.
