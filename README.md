# **NAME**

grcarma - GUI to molecular dynamics trajectories analysis program carma

# **SYNOPSIS**

grcarma [ PSF FILE ] [ DCD FILE ]

grcarma.exe [ PSF FILE ] [ DCD FILE ]

# **DESCRIPTION**

A paper describing the program in greater detail is available from [JCM](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jcc.23381). 

grcarma is a GUI to molecular dynamics trajectories analysis program 
[carma](http://utopia.duth.gr/~glykos/Carma.html). It is written in 
Perl and makes use of the Tk module for graphics. It is available for 
Linux, MACOSX and Windows, and requires the carma executable in the same folder 
( or in the PATH ). As seen in the synopsis the program can be launched 
with  a .psf / .dcd pair of files as arguments. Alternatively, the 
program can be run without any arguments and the user will be prompted
to specify the files to use for the analyses, through a graphical interface.

# **AUTHOR**
