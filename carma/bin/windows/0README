The executable provided in this directory was cross-compiled
on a GNU/Linux machine using wingw32 and it has been tested 
under windows XP. The executable was produced with something
like

gcc -DWINDOWS -Wall -pedantic -O carma.c -lm

and it uses numerical recipes' eigen-routines. 

The easiest (only ?) way to use the program on windows is
via the MS-DOS prompt. Needless to say that this executable
does not have graphics support.
