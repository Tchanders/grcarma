1. Go to bin/ subdirectory and see if you can find an executable
   suitable for your machine.    
   If not, you will have to build carma from source as described in
   the documentation and the src/README file.


2. Try your executable with your DCD file to make sure it compiled
   without problems : 

   carma -v -fit <myDCD> <myPSF>          (assuming CA atoms exist)

   If your executable is graphics-enabled (MacOSX & Linux), try 

   carma <myDCD> <myPSF>

   If everything goes as planned, continue. If not, please do
   mail me a description of the problem.


3. Place the executable in a suitable directory and/or define a 
   symbol for it.


4. Go to the doc/pdf/ subdirectory and have a look or print the
   documentation. You can also add a bookmark in your browser 
   pointing to the doc/html/carma.html file. A unix manual page
   is also available (in the man/ subdirectory).

5. For support, please write to the carma mailing list at

     http://groups.google.com/group/carma-molecular-dynamics
